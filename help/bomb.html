When this option is enabled, the generated report will have a bomb icon in certain cells under certain conditions:<br />
&quot;Small bombs&quot; appear in a cell if any trial that meets the search criteria has been terminated or suspended for more than 18 months AND there are other trials that meet the search criteria that are not yet recruiting, active not recruiting, enrolling by invitation, or recruiting in the highest phase. This information is found in the fields &quot;overall_status&quot; and &quot;phase&quot;.<br /><br/>
&quot;Big bombs&quot; appear in a cell if any trial that meets the search criteria has been terminated or suspended more than 18 months AND there are other NO other trials that meet the search criteria that are not yet recruiting, active not recruiting, enrolling by invitation, or recruiting in the highest phase.
